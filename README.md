# UFOs

# Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project is to document and make information regarding the sightings of UFOs across the country easily accessible. The page allows users to filter sightings based on date, city, state, country and shape of sightings.

# Results

When a user types values into the filter fields and presses Enter, the table is sorted, and only the appropriate values are displayed. For example, if the table is filtered by city value “La Mesa”, the result will be next:

If one more filter is added, for example ‘shape is light’, the output will change:

# Summary


This webpage provides a one stop shop for the retrieval of UFO sighting data, and it is relatively simple to use.
As usage increases, and resources become more available, options for improving the page should include:
1.	A break of data into various pages to allow a user to scroll from page to page vs. down a never-ending list with an option to select how many entries to see per page

2.	The ability to sort results based on column headers to better organize and simplify the user’s research
